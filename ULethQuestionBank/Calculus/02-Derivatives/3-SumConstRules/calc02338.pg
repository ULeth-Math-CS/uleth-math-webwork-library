Follow the steps to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function [`f(x) = [$f]`] at [`x =[$c]`].

This problem has three parts. You may only open the next part after correctly
completing the previous part.

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The line tangent to [`f(x)`] at [`x=[$c]`] meets the function at [`x = [$c]`] and therefore [`([$c], f([$c]))`] is on the tangent line, where [`f([$c]) = [$m]([$c]) + ([$b]) = [$ans1]`]. 

We use the Power Rule determine that [`f'(x) = [$ans2]`]. The slope of the tangent line at [`x = [$c]`] is [`f'([$c]) = [$ans3]`].

Recall: (the _point-slope_ form of a line) a line with slope [`m`] which passes through the point [`(x_0, y_0)`] has the form [`y - y_0 = m(x-x_0)`].

Therefore, the line tangent to the graph of [`f(x)`] at [`x = [$c]`] is [`y - ([$ans1]) = [$ans3](x - [$c]).`]

Rearranging, we have  [`y = [$ans4].`]
