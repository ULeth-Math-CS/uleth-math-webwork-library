# Part 1 problem text.
BEGIN_PGML
Let [`f(s) = [$f]`] and [`g(s) = [$g]`] so that [`h(s) = f(s) \cdot g(s)`]. 
Their respective derivatives are  

[`f'(s) = `][_____________]{Compute($df)} [@ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") @]*  
and  
[`g'(s) = `][_____________]{Compute($dg)}.
END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Product Rule - Part 2");
# Part 2 problem text.
BEGIN_PGML
Using the derivatives from Part 1 and the Product Rule,

[``h'(s) = (f \cdot g)'(s) 
= f'\cdot g + f\cdot g' = ``]
[`\Big(`][_____]{Compute($df)}[`\Big)`][`\cdot`][`\Big(`][_____]{Compute($g)}[`\Big)`] [`+`] [`\Big(`][_____]{Compute($f)}[`\Big)`][`\cdot`][`\Big(`][_____]{Compute($dg)}[`\Big)`].

Simplifying, we find that
[`h'(s) = `][_____]{Compute($dh)}.

END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin("Algebraic Manipulation");
# Part 3 problem text.
BEGIN_PGML

You may use algebra to expand [`h(s)`] before taking the derivative.  
In this instance, [`h(s)`] becomes [______________]{Compute($h)}.

We may then use the Power Rule to determine that
[`h'(s) = `][_____]{Compute($dh)}.

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

First, using the Product Rule,

[``
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    h'(s) &=& \frac{d}{ds}[[$f]]\cdot([$g]) + ([$f])\cdot \frac{d}{ds}[[$g]]\\
    &&\\
    &=& ([$df])([$g]) + ([$f])([$dg])  \\
  \end{array}
``]

After simplifying the last line, we find [`h'(s) = [$dh]`].

Next, expand [`h(s)`] first:

[``
  h(s) =  ([$f])([$g]) = [$h].
``]

Then, by Power Rule, we find [`h'(s) = [$dh]`].
