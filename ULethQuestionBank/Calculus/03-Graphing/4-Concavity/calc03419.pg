BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Since [`f(x) = [$f]`] is a polynomial, its domain is all real numbers,
or [`(-\infty, \infty)`].

Its first and second derivatives are, respectively, [` f'(x) = [$df] `] and [`f''(x) = [$ddf] `].  Set [`f''(x) = 0`] and solve: 

[``
  [$ddf] = 0 \;\Rightarrow \; x = [$crit].
``]

When [`x > [$crit]`], [`f''(x) > 0`] and so [`f`] is concave up
on [`([$crit], \infty) `].
When
[`x < [$crit]`], [`f''(x) < 0`] and so [`f`] is concave down
on [` (-\infty, [$crit]) `].

Therefore, there is an inflection point at [`x = [$crit]`].
Plug [`x`] into the original function to find the corresponding
[`y`]-value:

[``
  f([$crit]) = ([$crit])^3 + [$b2]([$crit])^2 + [$b1]([$crit]) + [$d]
  = [$y1]
``]  
The inflection point occurs at [` ([$crit], [$y1]) `].

Find critical numbers by setting [`f'(x) = 0`]:

[``
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    [$df] &=& 0 \\
    &&\\
    x &=& [$c1], [$c2]
  \end{array}
``]

Since [`f''([$c1]) < 0`], there is a local maximum 
at [`x = [$c1]`].  
Since [`f''([$c2]) > 0`], there is a local minimum 
at [`x = [$c2]`].

To find where [`f'(x)`] will have a relative extreme point,
first set [`f''(x) = 0`].  As seen above, [`x = [$crit]`] is
the only such point.  Now, since [`f'''(x) = 6 > 0`], there
must be a local minimum (by the Second Derivative Test applied to [`f'`]) at this point.
