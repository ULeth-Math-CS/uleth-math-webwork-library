BEGIN_PGML

[$art] [$ladder] foot ladder is leaning against a house while
the base is pulled away at a constant rate of [$spd] ft/s.
At what rate is the top of the ladder sliding down the
side of the house when the base is:



a. 1 foot from the house? [_________________________]{Compute($x1)} ft/s [@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*
b. 5 feet from the house? [_________________________]{Compute($x2)} ft/s
c. [$m] feet from the house? [_________________________]{Compute($x3)} ft/s

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Construct a right triangle with base [`x`] measuring
the distance from the house to the base of the ladder,
height [`y`] measuring from the ground to the top
of the ladder, and hypotenuse formed by the ladder
itself.  By the Pythagorean Theorem,

>>[``
  x^2 + y^2 = [$ladder]^2
``]<<


The goal is to find [` \dfrac{dy}{dt} `].
Differentiate both sides of the above equation with respect to [`t`].  

>>[``
  2x \dfrac{dx}{dt} + 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} = 0
``]<<

Then plug in [` \dfrac{dx}{dt} = [$spd]`] and solve for
the unknown rate.

>>[``
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    [$s2] x + 2y \dfrac{dy}{dt} &=& 0 \\
    &&\\
    \dfrac{dy}{dt} &=& -\dfrac{[$s2] x}{2y}
  \end{array}
``]<<

When [`x = 1`],

>>[``
  1^2 + y^2 = [$ladder]^2 \;\Rightarrow\; y = \sqrt{[$a1]}
``]<<

>>[``
  \Rightarrow \; \dfrac{dy}{dt}
  = -\dfrac{[$s2](1)}{2\sqrt{[$a1]}} = [$x1].
``]<<

When [`x = 5`],

>>[``
  5^2 + y^2 = [$ladder]^2 \;\Rightarrow\; y = \sqrt{[$a2]}
``]<<

>>[``
  \Rightarrow \; \dfrac{dy}{dt}
  = -\dfrac{[$s2](5)}{2\sqrt{[$a2]}} = [$x2].
``]<<


When [`x = [$m]`],

>>[``
  [$m]^2 + y^2 = [$ladder]^2 \;\Rightarrow\; y = \sqrt{[$a3]}
``]<<

>>[``
  \Rightarrow \; \dfrac{dy}{dt}
  = -\dfrac{[$s2]([$m])}{2\sqrt{[$a3]}} = [$x3].
``]<<


Each rate found above is negative, which indicates the top
of the ladder is falling.  Take the absolute value of
each to answer the questions.
